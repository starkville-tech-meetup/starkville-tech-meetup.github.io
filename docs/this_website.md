## Background

I do a lot of writing in Markdown professionally and personally[^1]. So, I figured the method for me to "make a website" that would scale well and not require the use of a [CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) would be to use a tool that could generate website pages from Markdown files.

Among the many different tools that do this job, I ended up using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) for my business site. This is mostly due to the fact that I essentially just want to convey useful information to people, and a documentation-centric design seems to fit that ethos. Not to mention that it's the first tool I dug into, and I'm just used to it. Not **committed** to it, just **used** to it. I'm very open to change, I just don't have the time to spend learning different tools to make a "perfect" modern website. All I wanted to do was communicate and hopefully not blind people with garrish appearances.

## Don't like how it looks or how it's structured?

As I said above, I'm open to change; I just don't have the time to spend on this since 1) I'm not getting paid and 2) I am not a design aficionado/expert. So, as long as it gets my point across, people keep expressing interest in coming to the events, and no one complains, I have no motivation to work on it. 

That said, if **you** want to volunteer your time to make suggestions as to the structure/UX or want to make direct contributions to the site's code, please see the [repo](https://github.com/starkville-tech-meetup/starkville-tech-meetup.github.io) for it (or click the logo at the top right of this page). If you make a contribution, note that I don't pay much attention to GitHub notifications, so message me via the Discord or another way if you have my contact info!

## Found an error? ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜…  

Please do message me via Discord or email (if you have that). You can also make a pull request to the repo (see above) if you have the time, but you will likely still need to notify me to accept it.
