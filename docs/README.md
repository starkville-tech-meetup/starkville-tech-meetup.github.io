# Ready to meet and talk to other tech folks?

We have begun a software development/technology-focused meetup in Starkville.  
The [first one was on 6/20/2025](archive/first_meetup.md), and we hope to have this event regularly!

If you are interested (either in attending or just curious as to future developments with this group), please fill out the form at the bottom of this page, join the Discord via the link below, and read the agenda linked below to get a feel for how the first event was structured.

### Further Reading

See [provided agenda](agenda_2025-06-20.md) for the 6/20 meeting.

For some tips on getting the most out of tech meetups, see the [resources page](resources.md).

You can also see one of the presentations given at the first event [here](presentations/quarto/what-to-expect-at-a-tech-meetup/what-to-expect-at-a-tech-meetup.html).
This was a more "meta" presentation, so don't expect this to be representative of what would normally be presented (assuming we do continue doing presentations, of course).
