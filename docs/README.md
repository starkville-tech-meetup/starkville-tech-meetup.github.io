# Ready to meet and talk to other tech folks?

We wanted to start a kind of software development/technology-focused meetup in Starkville.  
And hopefully have it regularly!

### Time and Place
The current plan for the first meeting is to have it around 7pm Friday June 20th (2025).  
(Or `2025-06-20 19:00:00` for you [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) people...)

This would take place at [the Hub](https://coworkmsu.com/).  
The parking lot is in the back (north side), and you can get to it either from east side or the northwest side of the building.  
Door entrances are on the north side (parking lot) and south side of the building; if you come in from the north/parking lot, you will need to go down the stairs.
