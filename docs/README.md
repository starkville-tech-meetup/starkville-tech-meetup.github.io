### Ready to meet and talk with other tech folks?

We have begun a software development/technology-focused meetup in Starkville.  
The [first one was on 6/20/2025](archive/first_meetup.md), and the next will be on 7/18/2025!
Please see the RSVP form at the bottom of this page if you are interested in coming to this event or just interested in general.

### Time and Place
The current plan for the July meeting is to start around 6pm Friday July 18th.

</a>

This will take place at [the Hub](https://coworkmsu.com/) ([301 E Main St., Starkville, MS](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Hub/@33.4640187,-88.8137437,19.83z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x88813510f01510dd:0x454a02eaf7bde9c7!8m2!3d33.4643121!4d-88.8137627!16s%2Fg%2F11y4364z1j?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYzMC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)).  
Note that parking is in the back of the building (2nd floor), but the doors are locked after hours. We will have a door greeter present at the second floor entrance from ~6:00-6:10pm, but you will need to come around the building to the first floor if you arrive after that point.


### Further Reading

See [provided agenda](agenda_2025-07-18.md) for the 7/18 meeting.

For some tips on getting the most out of tech meetups, see the [resources page](resources.md).

You can also see one of the presentations given at the first event <a href="presentations\quarto\what-to-expect-at-a-tech-meetup\what-to-expect-at-a-tech-meetup.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
This was a more "meta" presentation, so don't expect this to be representative of what would normally be presented (assuming we do continue doing presentations, of course).

 Discord seems to be the best way to stay in contact with the majority of people, but if you're interested in managing a page on other social media, let me know. 

Also, please note the logo used in the top right corner is not the final logo we will use. This is just a placeholder for now!
