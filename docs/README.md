For the foreseeable future, the meetups will take place at [the Hub](https://coworkmsu.com/) ([301 E Main St., Starkville, MS](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Hub/@33.4640187,-88.8137437,19.83z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x88813510f01510dd:0x454a02eaf7bde9c7!8m2!3d33.4643121!4d-88.8137627!16s%2Fg%2F11y4364z1j?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYzMC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)).  
Note that parking is in the back of the building (2nd floor), but the doors are locked after hours. We hope to have a door greeter at the second floor entrance from ~6:00-6:10pm, but you will need to come around the building to the first floor if you arrive after that point.

### Presentations

There will not be any lightning talks at this meetup, but hopefully there will be one next time!

Discord seems to be the best way to stay in contact with the majority of people, but if you're interested in managing a page on other social media, let me know!  
I currently just post and share from my personal accounts on Facebook and Nextdoor, but there are no pages for this group.
