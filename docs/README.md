### Presentations

From Dalton:
For this month, I'm thinking of trying to help out the students with skills they could use to help them thrive in their education.  
Since my impromptu demonstration of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) went over pretty well last time, and I feel that it is excellent as an educational tool, I'd like at least one presentation to be on it! 
Whether that is me or someone else that wants to talk about their note-taking journey, I think a well-structured introduction to using Obsidian 
would be an excellent use of presentation time! (If we get two other presentations, I may even try to squeeze in 3 lightning talks just to fit Obsidian in!)

If you have a presentation to share that fits the general trend of "educational tools/resources" or "scholarly- and tech-relevant advice", please [let me know](mailto:techconnect.gtr.ms@gmail.com)!
If you have something unrelated you would like to present at this next one or in the future, also [let me know](mailto:techconnect.gtr.ms@gmail.com)!

Discord seems to be the best way to stay in contact with the majority of people, but if you're interested in managing a page on other social media, let me know!  
I currently just post and share from my personal accounts on Facebook and Nextdoor, but there are no pages for this group.
