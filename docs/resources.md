## Enjoying your first tech meetup

* About halfway down [this article](https://codesubmit.io/blog/guide-to-tech-meetups/), in a section titled "Tips to enjoy your first tech meetup", there are some good suggestions on how to prep, act during, and follow-up after a tech meetup. It may or may not be relevant to this, but I would rather have more techniques/knowledge available to me than less!
* Included in the above tips is a mention of the "Pac-Man Rule"; I explicitly recommend reading [this article](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/) on that technique (including the video shown), as I found it super helpful to think about and visualize. 
* When researching starting this meetup, I found a [Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/xl9l0j/comment/ipizqgj/) that gave more tips/insights. Read it if you'd like more context into some my mindset in how I'm approaching this. (I say "I" because I don't want to speak on behalf of others in this specific case; this is my viewpoint, not anyone else's).
