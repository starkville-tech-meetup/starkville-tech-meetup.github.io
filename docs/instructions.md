# The Instructions

If you haven't come to one of these before today,  
**Hello and Welcome!**

You're probably wondering what is going on or what will happen.

### **Step 1: Sign in!**  
You can use the kiosk computer showing the Google Form, or scan the QR code on the sheet beside to enter your name. It doesn't have to be your full name, but it will come up later, so be sure you can recognize it!

### **Step 2: Get to listening and talking**  
The general goal is to meet other people, figure out what others are working on, find people with shared interests, and potentially make longer-term connections.
As the saying goes: It's not **what** you know, it's **who** you know. 
But I think we can do both here. Every time you talk with someone, you learn something from them. 
So, I want this event to be about growing both **who** you know AND **what** you know!

The main point of the first bit of the meetup is to just kinda listen to others and join in on conversations when you can. Don't be afraid to start a conversation (see the list of questions on the slideshow on the main screen if needed), but also be aware this part will be rather short (~15-20 minutes). 
(Some people say "You were born with two ears and one mouth, so you should listen twice as much as you talk". I think this is at least true in small group conversations; don't overspeak if you can help it!)

### **Step 3: Prepare and give an introduction**  
The second part will be a 'Round-the-Room introductions phase, where each of us will give a brief introduction to ourselves, such as:
- current role/degree program
- fun projects (including side projects)
- community involvement
- non-tech interests
- etc.

Basically anything you're open to mentioning, but probably at least partially relevant to technology in some way. And also keeping it within the allotted time!
(This is where the sign-in part comes into play!  That will be explained later, though.)

### **Step 4: Lightning talks**   
We will have 1 or 2 presentations in either the main room or the conference room. 
Those who want to listen are invited to attend, but you can also continue to talk with others instead!  
(This part is canceled for the 9/19 meeting due to lack of presenters.)

### **Step 5: Continued talking!**  
Just like Step 2, talk with people! Network, listen, talk, learn, teach, and grow!
There's lots of knowledge that could be had here. 

### **Step 6: Final thoughts and parting challenge**  
1. I hope you enjoyed meeting and hanging out with other people! IRL, even! 
2. If you enjoyed the event, want it to keep happening, and want others you know to attend, **please take one of the extra flyers and put it up somewhere in GTR** (Starkville, Columbus, and West Point) that you know people will see it! I can also send you the file to print on your own if you have access to those services.
3. Also, please **brainstorm potential local problems** we could work on as a group to solve! I think it would be really cool to have this group also be impactful locally. 
4. Finally, stay safe, stay curious, and stay connected!
