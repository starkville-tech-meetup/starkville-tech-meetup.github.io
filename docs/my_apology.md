# Dalton's Apology

I don't completely like the appearance of this site. 

Something is ... _off_. 
But I'm not a designer, and I can't yet make an argument to put in the effort to make it better. 

Following the "function over fashion" philosophy, 
I'm trying to make this informative first, and pleasant-looking second.

Unfortunately, my "shiny object syndrome" has me throwing random things together and seeing what happens (as evidenced by the weirdly-colored buttons...).

So, I apologize that it's not a work of art.  
And I make no promises on when it may get better...
