## Why You Should Use Obsidian for Knowledge Management

*Building a Better Brain with Better Tools*

---

## Why Writing Things Down is Awesome

I believe in having your thoughts "written" down (including digitally).

---

### Communication {.smaller}

Writing helps you think things through for yourself (like "Rubber Ducky Debugging").

. . .

**The Telephone Game Problem:**

- Brain → Mouth → Ears → Brain
- That's at least 3 steps of potential miscommunication!

. . .

Putting thoughts into optimal word choice helps ensure you communicate to other people's brains with **as little ambiguity as possible**.

---

### Memory {.smaller}

Our memory isn't actually that bad in general.

. . .

**But we're inundated with information...**

Do you have a favorite kind of commercial?

- Mine are the funny ones! 
- I can sing song-length jingles from the mid-2000s and early 2010s...
- But can I remember important work details? 🤔

---

### Memory Solutions

**Spaced Repetition:**
- Use tools with information baked in
- Write on physical or digital flashcards

. . .

**Or simply offload important memories by writing them down**

Maybe you'll remember them better because you wrote them down! 🤷‍♂️

### Creativity

> Everything you've ever read had to be written.

. . .

*Mic drop...*

### Many Other Reasons

## Why You Should Use Obsidian to Write

*Four Core Advantages*

---

### Portability {.smaller}
**Prefer Plain; Prohibit Proprietary**

- **Markdown is just "plain text"**
- No third-party tools needed to read and write
- **You own the files**
- Stored locally, offline work
- Easily syncable via cloud services

---

### Configurable {.smaller}
**Customize, Completely Change, and/or Combine Cool Components**

> *Alter and Adapt Almost All Appearances*

---

### Rich Plugin Ecosystem {.smaller}

Obsidian tackles basically everything most writing software does:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Themes
- Automations
- Templating
- Task management
- SQL queries
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Reward systems/gamification
- API services
- AI integration
- Git integration
- RSS feeds
:::

::::

. . .

**Over 2,600 community plugins** - most available for free!

*(I've thought about it almost similar to Emacs...)*

---

### Searchability {.smaller}
**Solution to Seek the Sweetest of Secrets**

You can find **anything**.

. . .

...

. . .

*pretty much anything*

. . .

There's even a plugin to let you search the settings (because it will grow to a point you can't keep in your own mental contexts).

---

### Linking {.smaller}
**Links Lead to Limitless Learning**

- Developing a web of knowledge takes time
- Accumulate knowledge and make connections organically
- Sometimes you notice something you didn't before!

---

### Other Reasons {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Simple to start
- **NAMED LINKS**
- Allows code (because Markdown)
- Graph view is pretty...
- Fast to write*
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Todo lists
- Long-term project management
- Automatability (templates, scripts)
- Lots and LOTS of extra features
:::

::::

*\*depending on computer power, computational need of plugins, etc.*
