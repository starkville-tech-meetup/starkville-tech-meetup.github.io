## Why You Should Use Obsidian for Knowledge Management

*Building a Better Brain with Better Tools*

## Why Writing Things Down is Awesome

I believe in having your thoughts "written" down (including digitally).

---

### Communication {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Writing helps you think things through for yourself (like "Rubber Ducky Debugging").
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**The Telephone Game Problem:**
:::
- Brain → Mouth → Ears → Brain
- That's at least 3 steps of potential miscommunication!

::: {.fragment .zoom-in}
Thoughts → optimal word choice → **reduces ambiguity**
:::

### Memory {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Our memory isn't actually that bad in general.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**But we're inundated with information...**
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Do you have a favorite kind of commercial?
:::

- Mine are the funny ones! 
- My crappy superpower: Remembering stupid song lyrics
- But can I remember important work details? 🤔

### Memory Solutions {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Spaced Repetition:**
:::
- Use tools with information baked in
- Write on physical or digital flashcards

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Or simply offload important memories by writing them down**
:::

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
Maybe you'll remember them better because you wrote them down! 🤷‍♂️
