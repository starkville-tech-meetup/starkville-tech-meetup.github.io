## 👋 Welcome

- We all automate more than we realize:
  - Setting up filters in Gmail
  - Using “Remember Me” on websites
  - Writing scripts or Excel macros
- But there's always more you can learn!

## 🕐 Why Do We Automate?

- Saves time on repetitive and/or boring tasks  
- Reduces mistakes
- Less context switching away from more imporant work
- _“If you do something more than twice, consider automating it.”_

---

## ⚙️ Classic Automation You Know

- script/batch files, cron jobs, `rsync`
- IFTTT (IF This Then That), browser extensions, mail merge  
- Excel macros
- Keyboard shortcuts 
- App defaults
- etc.

- ✅ Powerful, but often limited to **one platform**, **one device**, **single event/simple workflow**, or **power users only**

---

## 🚀 Added "Modern" Automation Options

- Native mobile automation
- Web-to-web app automation
- (+ Application-native automation)

---

## 📱 1. Native Phone Automations

### iOS (Shortcuts & Automations)
- Auto-text someone when leaving home  
- Turn on Focus mode when arriving at work  
- Tap a home-screen icon to trigger a multi-step routine
- Perform a settings change at certain time of day

---

### Android (Tasker or built-in routines)
- Change settings based on location/Wi-Fi  
- Auto-play Spotify when you connect headphones  
- Silence notifications when calendar says "Busy"
- Do task when scan a certain QR code


---

## 🌐 2. Web-to-Web (and local) Automation (Zapier, n8n, Windmill.dev)

These connect multiple apps together — like **digital data piping**.

### Zapier
- No-code automations for 1000s of web apps
- Ex: When a new row is added in Google Sheets → add to CRM -%3E Add card to Trello -> Send a warm-up email
- Ex. Once a day -> loop through list of contacts -> calculate some values -> output to Google Sheets

## ⚖️ 3. When to Use What

Considerations:

- Ample reliability
- Lesser your effort to set up
- Increased privacy

---

**What do you think?**

- Want to automate processing local files only on your computer?
    - downloaded apps, scripts (with or without windmill), cron jobs
- Want to automate the flow of data between web-based applications?
    - Zapier or hosted n8n/windmill if need 99% uptime, self-host n8n/windmill if want "more" privacy
- Want to flow data within a single web-based application?
    - See if that application has automations within it first!

---

**Choose the tool that fits your scope**  

- Use built-ins first (if exist)
- Use cloud services for app-to-app  
- Use local tools for privacy, scale, or file access

---

## Example with Zapier and Trello

- Yap, yap, yap...


---

## 🔁 Stack Automations for Extra Power

- Use iOS Shortcuts or Tasker to **trigger** Zapier workflows via webhooks
- Chain multiple actions: “When I get home → log the time → turn off Slack → start relaxing music”


---

## ❌ What I Didn't Discuss

- Usage of Artificial Intelligence
	- At least, not explicitly
- Proprietary or in-house tools
	- I don't know your work!
- Every option available to you
