## Three big ideas
- *Learn how to network / what networking is*
- *Find people that can help you solve problems*
- *Talk to people (outside of your major) that understand what you're saying*

---

## What are you learning in classes?
- theory
- hard/technical skills (programming, debugging, decomposing technical problems, etc.)
- soft/general skills (problem-solving, critical thinking, teamwork, etc.)

## But what about...

No, not this networking.

## Get help solving problems
*or inspriation on problems to solve*

Categories of people to talk to: 
:::
- people with problems
- people that have solved problems in various domains
- people that know how to translate problems between domains

::: notes
And networking isn't all about growing your career. 
It's also about just growing in your ability to talk with people about things you like.

<!-- And I don't mean necessarily corporate-career viewpoint.   -->
Think more about it from a *"How can I talk to people and help solve their problems?"* viewpoint.

## So, go!
- There will also be drinks (soda)/snacks/treats
- But don't count on a full meal...
