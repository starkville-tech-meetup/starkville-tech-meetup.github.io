- Networking
  - Meet new contacts
  - Deepen existing relationships

    - [But don't come in with the goal of finding a job](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12skl6r/comment/jgzk1cu/)
- Food
- Talk about cool things with people that understand you!
  - Or at least understand better


---

## Content

- Themed
  - company/organization (Google, Apple, CodeStack, etc. )
  - programming language (C++, Rust, Python, Javascipt, APL, COBOL, Ada, Haskell, Swift, Clojure, etc.)
  - even a specific framework, like Rails or React
- Focus on jobs/roles/industries (computer graphics, scientific computation, data analysis, automation, etc.)
- Demographics ([minority groups](https://www.cio.com/article/193688/professional-organizations-focused-on-diversity-in-tech.html), [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/), [high schoolers](https://www.lumiere-education.com/post/10-amazing-conferences-for-high-school-students-in-2024-2025), etc.)
- "Technical" vs "Business"

---

## Format

- In-person - less convenient, but more personable
- Online - more convenient, but more detached
- Hybrid - maybe best of both, if implemented well
- Asynchronous - this is a lecture...
- Note: Heavily influences the type of presentations and other events that can occur. 

--- 

## Format - Events
- Networking-centric
- Presentations
- Workshops
- Tech Demos
- Company Rep Tables

## Audience

- Large crowd?
- Small gathering/group?
  - Both valid!
- Depends on:
  - Did they hear about it? (where they targeted in any specific media?)
  - Do they want to go? (maybe many people after Covid...)
  - Can they make it? (People are busy!)
- You really shouldn't have to tailor your behavior based on who's there, but it's worth to bear in mind...

# Tips to enjoy your first tech meetup


---

## Beforehand - Research, Reach out, and "Recruit"
- Look into the group (if exists) and attendees.
- Ask a host about what to expect.
- Introduce yourself to others ahead of time if there's some kind of chat associated with the event.
- (Not relevant yet) Research interview questions if your goal is to get your foot in the door with a recruiter
  - But [don't try too hard](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12skl6r/comment/jgzk1cu/)...
- If feeling nervous, bring someone with you! However, it is a heck of a lot easier to meet people when you are acting alone, so be prepared to split up at some point!

---

## During - Chat, Keep Room, and Contact
- If someone's standing alone, start a conversation!
- Remember the [Pac-Man Rule](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/)
- Keep questions in your head to ask people; both to start and to continue conversations
- Get contact info if want to keep in touch outside of these meetups
  - We have a Discord to help simplify this a bit!

---

## Afterward - Message and Momentum
- Message a thanks to those you met (depending on if you got their info)
- Continue looking into tech meetups!

---

## Future steps
- Prepare to [Present](https://www.sanity.io/blog/why-you-should-do-your-first-tech-talk)!
- Help with organization
- Give ideas for topics for other presenters
